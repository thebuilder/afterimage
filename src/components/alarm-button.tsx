/**
 * The one control on the page that is not text.
 *
 * The lamp is a layer over the button rather than the button itself. It sits at
 * `-inset-px` so the flash brightens the edge the button already has instead of
 * drawing a second one inside it, and behind the label so the wash never pulses
 * the one piece of copy that has to stay readable. `isolate` on the button is
 * what makes that negative z-index mean "above the border, below the words"
 * rather than "behind the whole section".
 *
 * Pointing at it answers the alarm, so the alarm stops: a lamp still flashing
 * under the cursor puts a second glow over the hover glow and the button
 * flickers while you are aiming at it.
